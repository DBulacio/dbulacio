### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning VueJS and looking to work as a programmer!
- ðŸ”­ I have 4 years of experience with PHP & MySQL and some experience working with JavaScript but I want to do more than just web apps. I want to understand how code really works and get to the roots of every problem... We'll see what happens!
